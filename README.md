# üöÄ Crypto Portfolio Tracker

A production-grade, multichain cryptocurrency wallet tracker featuring a real-time GraphQL API and a reactive Next.js frontend.

**Live Demo: Coming Soon**

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a robust, scalable, and maintainable portfolio tracker by orchestrating best-in-class third-party APIs. It showcases expertise in modern full-stack development, API design, and production-grade infrastructure.

Instead of building a custom data indexer from scratch, this application leverages a strategic, API-driven approach to deliver a feature-rich experience quickly and reliably, demonstrating a pragmatic approach to software engineering.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Multi-Chain Tracking**: Instantly view token balances, NFTs, and transaction history across major EVM chains like Ethereum, Polygon, and Base, powered by the Zapper and Covalent APIs.
* ‚úÖ **Live Portfolio Analytics**: Get a real-time overview of your net worth with historical value charts, performance metrics, and PnL calculations.
* ‚úÖ **In-Depth DeFi Positions**: Track your supplied assets, borrows, and rewards from leading DeFi protocols like Aave, Uniswap, and Compound.
* ‚úÖ **Real-time API**: A unified GraphQL API aggregates data from multiple sources and streams updates to the frontend via WebSockets.
* ‚úÖ **Deep Observability**: End-to-end distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger provides critical insights into application performance and behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture

This project uses a modern, API-driven architecture designed for scalability and maintainability.

* **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query
* **Backend (API)**: GraphQL Yoga, Prisma, Apollo Client (for API federation)
* **Data Sources**: Zapper API, Covalent API, CoinGecko API
* **Database**: TimescaleDB (for time-series data), Redis (for caching)
* **Infrastructure**: Docker, Turborepo, GitHub Actions
* **Observability**: OpenTelemetry, Jaeger (Tracing), Prometheus/Grafana (Metrics - planned)

## üî≠ API Overview

The GraphQL API provides queries, mutations, and subscriptions for wallet and portfolio management.

* **Queries**:
  * `wallet(address: String!, chain: Chain!): Wallet`
  * `portfolio(walletAddresses: [String!]!): Portfolio`
  * `transactions(walletAddress: String!, chain: Chain!): TransactionConnection!`
* **Mutations**:
  * `addWallet(input: AddWalletInput!): Wallet!`
  * `syncWallet(address: String!, chain: Chain!): SyncResult!` (Refreshes data from APIs)
* **Subscriptions**:
  * `priceUpdates(tokenIds: [ID!]!): TokenPrice!`

Explore the full schema live at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.
